# Game_Of_Thrones_death_prediction
Game of Thrones Character death prediction

This project was done to clean and analyze a dataset consisting of factors that influence charcter deaths from the popular "A Song Of Ice And Fire" mostly known through the popular TV series "Game Of Thrones"

STEP 1

Download all the files, a zip file is also availabe for your convenience. After extracting all the files, open any Python IDE (This project was created with Spyder) and change the working directory to the one with the folder containing all the files. OR, open the command prompt, go to the root directory with all the files, and write the command python my_got.py to execute the python file.(It is better to open the python file in an IDE to make sure all the dependencies are installed correctly and the code is error free.)

STEP 2 Install the dependencies and execute the code.

STEP 3 Open the file called "GOT_report" to read the report.

STEP 4 do not hesitate to get in touch regarding any feedback or questions :)

Thank you.
